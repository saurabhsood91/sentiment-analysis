ID-0795	This hotel was mediocre. It did not live up to the hilton hype. It was not priced correctly for the service I got. It was nothing in particular that caught my eye. The lobby looked like a HG t.v. magazine threw up in it. The indoor pool might as well had been outside due to the fact it was a random pigeon flying about freely. The food was not as well prepared as I had expected. The menu was drab and had a small selection. I really thought I was ordering from a kids menu. The room I was in had such a filthy carpet. It was like the people before me threw a party then checked out when I checked in. The bed was ok, but for 123 dollars a nite it should have been stellar. The bathroom was also a little let down. The tub could barely fit my husband. I would not ask anyone to pay for a stay here. I paid the hilton price for a motel six stay.
ID-0899	I didn't enjoy my experience in this hotel because their were insects in my hotel room and it seemed very dirty.
ID-0969	Me and my family stayed here during the 4th of July weekend as a family get-together and birthday party. The resort has it's own water park, which is nice, but that's about as far as nice got. Upon arriving, the rooms were not what had been described to the person who purchased all of the rooms, and they had to purchase an additional room to make up for the misunderstanding. Later, one of the rooms was charged to another family member who checked in early. Another family member was charged with room service fees for meals they never ordered or received (watch your credit cards closely!). The rooms were dated and the carpeting was gross. The location of the rooms are literally a drive from the front desk, so if you need anything, it's going to take a while. And the maid service? Non-existent until the morning we were all due to leave. For the price, this place was atrocious, and I would never recommend staying here, even with the water park (the added resort fee pays for that). Save your money.
ID-0849	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is not even a hotel that I would send my worst enemy. Not only is the place in the middle of the armpit of America (Reno), but the hotel is just a mess. Everything, and I mean, everything smells like smoke. The smoking is supposed to be in the casino area only, but that is hardly the case. There are multiple restaurants, but they are usually closed and the food is horrible anyway. It is terribly old and it definitely shows in the rooms and in the casino. It is in serious need of a renovation asap.
ID-0967	We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there. The room was not clean, we had to scrub the bathtub before we even thought about using it. Airplanes continually roared above our room, which must have been right under a major landing path for the nearby airport. We expected a higher level of service and room amenities than we received. The outdoor pool was not heated, and it was frigid for late-August. The pool area was also not clean. We were glad for the morning to come so that we could leave and be on our way.
ID-0981	I am a business traveler that often had to stay at this hotel because the other options in the area were often sold out or more expensive (would get rejected by my corporate policy).Repeatedly, I was disappointed with this hotel. This hotel is stuck in a time warp for renovations and basic amenities. Even with recent updates in the lobby, the actual rooms lack the much needed updates. On one occassion, my room did not have towels or a shower curtain! Yes, the hotel can fix this but it shows the lack of effort and attention to each room. For a frequent traveler, I found the beds uncomfortable and lumpy. The blow dryer was old and while it seems like a small piece, it's an important luxury. The toiletries were as basic as they come and this is a Courtyard, I expect body lotion or conditioner! I have voiced my concerns to management and been contacted before but never heard back about changes being made. In 2011, I had to spend 78 nights here. I could change my travel schedule to avoid overnights so I would not have to stay here.
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer. The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping! I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water! All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.
ID-0957	I booked this hotel last week while visiting Philly. I am generally a fan of Hilton properties so when I called Hilton they offered this hotel which they stated was 15 minutes from downtown Philly. Boy where they wrong. this hotel was actually a 40 minute drive from the downtown area. When my girlfriend and I checked in, we did not realize that they were renovating the lobby and certain rooms, I with the telephone representative would have stated this!!Also, they gave us a corner room on the 2nd floor all the way at the rear of the building. The door to our room was ajar when we entered so I thought something was suspicious. there was a 30 minute delay in order to switch us to a different room. not a good experience. will not stay until the renovations are all done.
ID-0809	We arrived at the hotel about 5 pm. First of all google maps gave us the wrong address. Sent us 10 miles up the road. (not blaming the hotel). Then we went up to our room and the A/C was not working properly. The ac knob was broken and we could not turn it on or off. It took them about 2 hours to get someone up to fix it. Besides that the stay was blah. Nothing major or nothing to get excited about. I requested a partial refund and finally got one only because I am a priority member.
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!
ID-1242	I loved the time I spent at the Luxor. It combined an elegant design with an amazing staff. We stayed near the very top of the pyramid, and the view of the city was simply breathtaking. Even something as simple as using the elevator was a fun experience. Instead of simply going up and down, it's structured to take the unique slant of the hotel into consideration.
ID-1110	I loved the experience I had at this hotel/resort. The hotel was clean and organized. The heated pool was very nice when it was late and a little windy. The restaurant food was very delicious and fresh. The variety of food in the restaurant amazing. They had many typical Mexican dishes that were amazing. The beach was crystal clear and the sand was clean. I did not have to fear of getting cut or hurting my feet.
ID-1056	This is easily Seattle's most elegant hotel. The Fireside Room, a stunning, wood-paneled lounge on the first floor of the building, is in itself worth a visit. With frequent live jazz performances and cocktails, it transports you to a bygone era. The rooms themselves, though on the small side, are dripping with atmosphere. The furnishings are elegant, the walls accented with wonderful period details, and the bookcase (filled with real books) is a wonderful touch. Everything, from the bathrooms to the linens, has a wonderful, lived-in feel. And best of all, the hotel is only a few blocks from downtown! The location is especially ideal for those doing business at the conference center, which is only a short walk away. If you want a homey, refined atmosphere, The Sorrento can't be beat.
ID-1130	On my last vacation, I decided I wanted to go to a place that was quaint and quiet, but still had a suitable level of culture to partake in. This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future. Thanks Planters Inn!
ID-1100	I had one of my best hotel experiences in this establishment. This hotel is located right on the beach, had plenty of amenities and the people (both guests and employees) were full of energy and really made me feel both welcome and happy.
ID-1190	America's Best Value Inn - Golden Gate is just that, a great value near Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel was located near several different bus stop lines, which made travel around the city very simple. The Golden Gate Bridge was about a ten minute ride away. As for the hotel itself, the staff was very friendly, they held our bags for us when we got there earlier then expected and also let us check in about two hours early after that. The room we booked was a King Suite and the size was great for only $50something per night. We joined their free discount club before we went, so the room was a great deal. The shower had plenty of hot water and the bathroom was clean. We had never been to San Francisco before and so we didn't spend too much time in the hotel but it was clean, the bed was large and comfortable and the staff was great. We plan on staying with them next time we travel to SF.
ID-1192	The Pearl River Hilton offers an incredibly upscale experience. The hotel boasts 17 acres of extraordinary landscape, a full pool, and a gourmet restaurant on premise. The staff is extremely friendly, and the rooms are very comfortable - all with a great view! Additionally, there are many conference and event rooms in a separate wing available for your next special event.
ID-1256	Indian Hills Inn Taos Plaza is a great place to stay, especially for the price. We were in the middle of everything -- the shops, the restaurants -- and could pretty much walk everywhere. The parking was great, even though our stay was during Spring Break. The room was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We'll book again the next time we're in Taos.
ID-1144	I like the motel 6, it was very affordable for what it was. Didn't have a bad odor like most motels. Pretty clean rooms.They are pet friendly so I didn't have to pay extra for my dog. Which is a money saver. I like the pool in the middle of the property where you can see rooms from pool.
ID-1076	Recently, I stayed in Las Vegas at the Motel 6 Tropicana. I loved this Motel 6. It was newly remodeled, and they allow pets. I travel with my dogs, so being able to bring them in is a plus. The newly remodeled room was very pleasant. I stayed in a non smoking room. It was very clean. The bathroom was spacious! The room was decorated in bright colored paint, and had a flat panel TV. The Motel 6 Tropicana, is located two blocks from the Strip. It made walking to the Strip a breeze. The staff was very helpful in finding a room on the first floor of the two story hotel. I also travel with small children, and needed to be able to access the room without the hassel of stairs. I'm planning another trip to Las Vegas in the very near future. I've already booked a room at the Motel 6 Tropicana.
