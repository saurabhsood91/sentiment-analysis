ID-0893	This Red Roof Inn in North Charleston, South Carolina is pretty inexpensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. The location is terrible. It’s right off the interstate in a very busy, loud commercial area. It should also be noted that it’s not as close to the historic downtown and beach areas in Charleston as you might be lead to believe. We got there a little early and the room wasn’t ready, so we went to a nearby Starbucks for about an hour. We came back after check-in time, and the room still wasn’t ready. They lady at the desk was nice but incompetent. When we finally got into a room, it was what you’d expect from a cheap hotel, and it smelled of cigarettes and cheap cleaning products. I think the worst part of it all was the other clientele there. We had a room on the second floor, which required climbing two flights of stairs. Some very unsavory individuals were always hanging out on the stairs and the landing. It made me really uncomfortable to walk to and from my car. Next time, I’ll pay extra and stay somewhere else.
ID-0817	The hotel has very thin walls and ceiling so you can hear EVERYTHING. You can even hear full conversations word-for-word. Even when we complained to have someone tell the person above us to be quiet, the manager didn't do anything at all. There was a county fair going on with bus fulls of high school kids having a party right outside our door and were shooting off fireworks. However, no one told them to be quiet. All the manager told us was that we could leave (without a refund).
ID-0803	On my way home from a trip with my family, the drive was taking longer than expected, so we decided to stay in a hotel for the evening. It was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. Unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. The walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. When they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. The room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. Also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed Big Foot. Overall, it was a terrible experience.
ID-0811	The Rio hotel is the absolute worst hotel I've stayed in on or just off the strip! It had the worst service! As we would stroll down the rundown hallways the smell of room service dishes and smoke was so dissapointing! The same left over food was left out for our two days stay. We could smell smoke in our rooms from the casino. My husband had trouble sleeping as the neon lights could be seen in our rooms with the curtains drawn. The casino was like an old bar room. Really bad ventilation! Last but not least! It took over sixty minutes to check out!
ID-0987	The Ao Chalong Hotel in Phuket, Thailand was a huge disappointment. We wanted to have a nice, somewhat luxury vacation, me and my two friends. We arrived at a later hour (but had informed the hotel that we would get in later because of our late flight) and the staff was extremely unfriendly. Since there were three of us traveling together it was difficult to find rooms that accommodated three people. However, when we booked with Ao Chalong we specifically stated that we would be three people and need a third bed. From the get go, the hotel had our reservation completely wrong and were extremely disrespectful to us. They made us very uncomfortable and the accommodations were terrible. We could hear everything from the other rooms and the locations were ugly and in terrible state. Stay away from this hotel.
ID-0929	When I visited this hotel, I thought everything was going to be great. It's appearance was not too shabby, but as soon as I got to the room, my opinion began to change. The room was nowhere near the quality that the rest of the hotel was; it only came with the basics, and nothing more. I would have expected more from a nicer hotel. The other surprising thing about this hotel was the staff. I did not feel secure at all. When I first came to my room to find my wife, she was not there (and I did not have a key). I simply came to the door, knocked, and waited one second. The maid down the hall came over and let me in the room. I could have been some stranger that was knocking on someone's room! I will not go back to that hotel because of this safety issue. Thank you.
ID-0801	We were visiting Salem and only stayed one night at this location. The room felt...and smelled dirty. It smelled like it had at one point been a smoking room that they were attempting to cover up and re-purpose as a non smoking room. The water in the hotel also had a funny taste and there were no alternatives to tap water provided that they were not charging a ridiculous amount for. All in all any mildly redeeming qualities did not make up for the sanitary levels of the room we stayed in.
ID-0923	The inclusion of insects in your hotel room isn't anything to be thrilled about. The motel 6 hotelier establishments typically have permissable conditions, however a particular experience of mind was quite atrocious. The room had a faint odor or must to it that denoted mold or mildew in the bathroom area. Also the maids or cleaning staff enter your room without knocking first, promptly apologizing however the damage has already been done. I do not appreciate people unlocking my door at a whim's notice and having complete unhindered access to my valuables which are extremely important. Documents such as my passport and my wallet were placed into the electrical safe only to find that the safe did NOT lock and opened with a universal key code of 00000. I will not be returning to this hotel if I can help it.
ID-0871	This was our first and only stay at the Ambassador hotel in New Orleans. When arriving we had to wait for five minutes before anyone even asked us about checking in. We paid for a deluxe room only to find that the room did not have a window looking to the outside. I must point out I said a window looking to the outside as we did in fact have a window looking out into the hallway? Also it had flimsy blinds covering the window, hardly blocking anyone from looking right in at the bed. It was mid-may in New Orleans which means its already hotter than a firecracker on the fourth of July, the air conditioning would barely work even after we left it on full blast for 6 hours. The only way to tell it was even on beside the rumbling of the motor was to lay your face on the vent to feel the semi cool air. After complaining to the hotel staff we were brushed off and never was able to get a hold of them again. I would HIGHLY not recommend this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy. As the room may bake you alive with the heat and the staff just do not care.
ID-0795	This hotel was mediocre. It did not live up to the hilton hype. It was not priced correctly for the service I got. It was nothing in particular that caught my eye. The lobby looked like a HG t.v. magazine threw up in it. The indoor pool might as well had been outside due to the fact it was a random pigeon flying about freely. The food was not as well prepared as I had expected. The menu was drab and had a small selection. I really thought I was ordering from a kids menu. The room I was in had such a filthy carpet. It was like the people before me threw a party then checked out when I checked in. The bed was ok, but for 123 dollars a nite it should have been stellar. The bathroom was also a little let down. The tub could barely fit my husband. I would not ask anyone to pay for a stay here. I paid the hilton price for a motel six stay.
ID-0899	I didn't enjoy my experience in this hotel because their were insects in my hotel room and it seemed very dirty.
ID-0969	Me and my family stayed here during the 4th of July weekend as a family get-together and birthday party. The resort has it's own water park, which is nice, but that's about as far as nice got. Upon arriving, the rooms were not what had been described to the person who purchased all of the rooms, and they had to purchase an additional room to make up for the misunderstanding. Later, one of the rooms was charged to another family member who checked in early. Another family member was charged with room service fees for meals they never ordered or received (watch your credit cards closely!). The rooms were dated and the carpeting was gross. The location of the rooms are literally a drive from the front desk, so if you need anything, it's going to take a while. And the maid service? Non-existent until the morning we were all due to leave. For the price, this place was atrocious, and I would never recommend staying here, even with the water park (the added resort fee pays for that). Save your money.
ID-0849	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is not even a hotel that I would send my worst enemy. Not only is the place in the middle of the armpit of America (Reno), but the hotel is just a mess. Everything, and I mean, everything smells like smoke. The smoking is supposed to be in the casino area only, but that is hardly the case. There are multiple restaurants, but they are usually closed and the food is horrible anyway. It is terribly old and it definitely shows in the rooms and in the casino. It is in serious need of a renovation asap.
ID-0967	We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there. The room was not clean, we had to scrub the bathtub before we even thought about using it. Airplanes continually roared above our room, which must have been right under a major landing path for the nearby airport. We expected a higher level of service and room amenities than we received. The outdoor pool was not heated, and it was frigid for late-August. The pool area was also not clean. We were glad for the morning to come so that we could leave and be on our way.
ID-0981	I am a business traveler that often had to stay at this hotel because the other options in the area were often sold out or more expensive (would get rejected by my corporate policy).Repeatedly, I was disappointed with this hotel. This hotel is stuck in a time warp for renovations and basic amenities. Even with recent updates in the lobby, the actual rooms lack the much needed updates. On one occassion, my room did not have towels or a shower curtain! Yes, the hotel can fix this but it shows the lack of effort and attention to each room. For a frequent traveler, I found the beds uncomfortable and lumpy. The blow dryer was old and while it seems like a small piece, it's an important luxury. The toiletries were as basic as they come and this is a Courtyard, I expect body lotion or conditioner! I have voiced my concerns to management and been contacted before but never heard back about changes being made. In 2011, I had to spend 78 nights here. I could change my travel schedule to avoid overnights so I would not have to stay here.
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer. The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping! I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water! All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.
ID-0957	I booked this hotel last week while visiting Philly. I am generally a fan of Hilton properties so when I called Hilton they offered this hotel which they stated was 15 minutes from downtown Philly. Boy where they wrong. this hotel was actually a 40 minute drive from the downtown area. When my girlfriend and I checked in, we did not realize that they were renovating the lobby and certain rooms, I with the telephone representative would have stated this!!Also, they gave us a corner room on the 2nd floor all the way at the rear of the building. The door to our room was ajar when we entered so I thought something was suspicious. there was a 30 minute delay in order to switch us to a different room. not a good experience. will not stay until the renovations are all done.
ID-0809	We arrived at the hotel about 5 pm. First of all google maps gave us the wrong address. Sent us 10 miles up the road. (not blaming the hotel). Then we went up to our room and the A/C was not working properly. The ac knob was broken and we could not turn it on or off. It took them about 2 hours to get someone up to fix it. Besides that the stay was blah. Nothing major or nothing to get excited about. I requested a partial refund and finally got one only because I am a priority member.
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!
