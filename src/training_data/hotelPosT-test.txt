ID-1204	This hotel was fantastic, everything about it was simply amazing. Not only that, but on my first attempt to find the place, my GPS took me to the wrong location (another Hyatt Place) and even THAT location was clean, and had nice attendants who promptly directed me to the other location.  The price and amenities are simply unbeatable. Due to extending my stay, I had to switch hotels, and let me say, this hotel offered twice the value at half the cost. When you enter, the room is split into multiple rooms, the TV is huge and HD, the WiFi is free, and the beds are so comfortable. Downstairs, they have a 24/7 desert bar, you simply walk down, tell them what you want, and they add it to your tab (they don't even ask for your room number, they remember it!). So convenient and amazing. When you show up, they even offer you a personalized tour!  And when you wake up, stop by the breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are to die for.
ID-1216	I have no complaints and I’m a picky hotel guest. The room was clean, the sheets were not old, and the bathroom was spotless. Everything worked properly which made for a great experience while getting ready for an interview. The front desk staff was more the helpful. They gave us advice on where to eat, information on the city, and the place I was interviewing at. The continental breakfast had lots of unique options; it went beyond the average spread at a hotel. I’m impressed.
ID-1088	Thsi is the mose beautiful place I have ever stayed. A very small 40 room French style hotel. The staff is exceptional and the beach is the best in all of Jamaica.  Very clean and the rooms are great. Clive the beach security is the best ever in keeping all the venodors away from you so you can relax
ID-1114	From the moment you walk in, you know the experience at the Westin is going to be a fantastic one. The staff behind the counter are friendly and the bellhop will take your bags to your room while you check in. Everyone is dressed nicely and act very professionally; something you expect from such a high quality hotel. The rooms are large with nice flat-screen televisions to watch while you're laying on a goose feather down comforter. The bathroom is equally as impressive with marble floors, a large back lit mirror and a walk in shower that has stone tile! The in house restaurant has a variety of delicious menu options to eat while you look out over the pool deck. Valet parking is available as well and can be called from your room so you don't have to wait! I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone seeking luxury and comfort during their stay.
ID-1122	I stayed at the Red Lion in Anehiem, CA. It was within walking distance of Disneyland, which was great. The interior of the hotel was beautiful. The marble floors in the lobby were goreous. The room was tastefully decorated, with a beautiful bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was clean. The housekeeping was great. I also loved the great HD TV available in the room. I would stay again!
ID-1254	My wife and I spent our honeymoon at Sandals Grande St. Lucian and absolutely fell in love the place. Our room was very spacious and had a nice flat screen TV. There was also three different pools to choose from. The main pool even had a swim up bar. Even better yet, the beach was amazing. This was true a true paradise.
ID-1196	When my family and I were on college visiting trips, this is one of the hotels we unfortunately stayed in. First off, the hotel was no where near the University campus, even though it was construed on the website that they were within walking distance. Note: I contacted their corporate offices and they have since taken this fact out of the hotels description.  The room was not no terribly spacious and the decor / ambiance of the room was very dated; think old floral paintings and an outdated lead-screen TV.  And it smelled! Oh dear god did it smell bad in that room. At one point, our family actually had to switch rooms entirely just to avoid the odor emanating from the bowels of Hell itself.  Would I ever go back to this hotel? Absolutely not.
ID-1118	I live in Houston and I usually stay at the Galvez Hotel on Galveston Island at least one or two times a year, as I live in Houston, which is about an hour away in good traffic. I like to go down there as a quick weekend getaway, to relax and unwind. They have a bed and breakfast deal that suits my needs perfectly. I’ve always liked their historical ambience, and they’ve updated the décor in recent times which makes it an even more attractive place. The staff is always pleasant and the rooms are always clean, peaceful and quiet, which are all major attractions for me. The hotel is supposed to be haunted, and I would love to see a ghost, but to date, I have never had so much as one paranormal experience. Despite my lack of ghostly encounters, I still love staying at the hotel because of its historic ambience, tranquility and beachfront location. One of my more pleasant memories of the Galvez is standing on the beach there at dawn, with coffee in hand and watching the sun come up over the ocean. The hotel is close to several of Galveston’s attractions that I like to visit. I come down to eat at nearby Pier 21 and have one of their shrimp poor boys, go shopping on the Strand and visit Moody gardens, which has a great saltwater aquarium and a wonderful rainforest pyramid, loaded with tropical birds and butterflies. If you want a loud, crazy place, then fly to Las Vegas, but if you need to relax and unwind, stay at the Hotel Galvez on Galveston Island.
ID-1152	The W Hotel in San Francisco, is conveniently located close to the Mascone Convention center and a couple blocks from San Francisco's shopping district - Union Square. The very chic and trendy hotel is well furnished, full of amenities like a gym and indoor pool, and the service is top notch. The rooms are very modern and there are several bars located within the building. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and will help guide if the most knowledgeable guest. I had the privilege to spend a weekend here and I won't hesitate to do it again next time I'm in the area. The hotel is also a stone's throw away from the SFMOMA - San Francisco museum of modern art for the art lovers out there.
ID-1242	I loved the time I spent at the Luxor. It combined an elegant design with an amazing staff. We stayed near the very top of the pyramid, and the view of the city was simply breathtaking. Even something as simple as using the elevator was a fun experience. Instead of simply going up and down, it's structured to take the unique slant of the hotel into consideration.
ID-1110	I loved the experience I had at this hotel/resort. The hotel was clean and organized. The heated pool was very nice when it was late and a little windy. The restaurant food was very delicious and fresh. The variety of food in the restaurant amazing. They had many typical Mexican dishes that were amazing. The beach was crystal clear and the sand was clean. I did not have to fear of getting cut or hurting my feet.
ID-1056	This is easily Seattle's most elegant hotel. The Fireside Room, a stunning, wood-paneled lounge on the first floor of the building, is in itself worth a visit. With frequent live jazz performances and cocktails, it transports you to a bygone era. The rooms themselves, though on the small side, are dripping with atmosphere. The furnishings are elegant, the walls accented with wonderful period details, and the bookcase (filled with real books) is a wonderful touch. Everything, from the bathrooms to the linens, has a wonderful, lived-in feel. And best of all, the hotel is only a few blocks from downtown! The location is especially ideal for those doing business at the conference center, which is only a short walk away. If you want a homey, refined atmosphere, The Sorrento can't be beat.
ID-1130	On my last vacation, I decided I wanted to go to a place that was quaint and quiet, but still had a suitable level of culture to partake in. This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future. Thanks Planters Inn!
ID-1100	I had one of my best hotel experiences in this establishment. This hotel is located right on the beach, had plenty of amenities and the people (both guests and employees) were full of energy and really made me feel both welcome and happy.
ID-1190	America's Best Value Inn - Golden Gate is just that, a great value near Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel was located near several different bus stop lines, which made travel around the city very simple. The Golden Gate Bridge was about a ten minute ride away. As for the hotel itself, the staff was very friendly, they held our bags for us when we got there earlier then expected and also let us check in about two hours early after that. The room we booked was a King Suite and the size was great for only $50something per night. We joined their free discount club before we went, so the room was a great deal. The shower had plenty of hot water and the bathroom was clean. We had never been to San Francisco before and so we didn't spend too much time in the hotel but it was clean, the bed was large and comfortable and the staff was great. We plan on staying with them next time we travel to SF.
ID-1192	The Pearl River Hilton offers an incredibly upscale experience. The hotel boasts 17 acres of extraordinary landscape, a full pool, and a gourmet restaurant on premise. The staff is extremely friendly, and the rooms are very comfortable - all with a great view! Additionally, there are many conference and event rooms in a separate wing available for your next special event.
ID-1256	Indian Hills Inn Taos Plaza is a great place to stay, especially for the price. We were in the middle of everything -- the shops, the restaurants -- and could pretty much walk everywhere. The parking was great, even though our stay was during Spring Break. The room was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We'll book again the next time we're in Taos.
ID-1144	I like the motel 6, it was very affordable for what it was. Didn't have a bad odor like most motels. Pretty clean rooms.They are pet friendly so I didn't have to pay extra for my dog. Which is a money saver. I like the pool in the middle of the property where you can see rooms from pool.
ID-1076	Recently, I stayed in Las Vegas at the Motel 6 Tropicana. I loved this Motel 6. It was newly remodeled, and they allow pets. I travel with my dogs, so being able to bring them in is a plus. The newly remodeled room was very pleasant. I stayed in a non smoking room. It was very clean. The bathroom was spacious! The room was decorated in bright colored paint, and had a flat panel TV. The Motel 6 Tropicana, is located two blocks from the Strip. It made walking to the Strip a breeze. The staff was very helpful in finding a room on the first floor of the two story hotel. I also travel with small children, and needed to be able to access the room without the hassel of stairs. I'm planning another trip to Las Vegas in the very near future. I've already booked a room at the Motel 6 Tropicana.
